## Postit!

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dgwolff/tealeaf-postit/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dgwolff/tealeaf-postit)

This is the app from [Tealeaf Academy's](http://gotealeaf.com) Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course.

It's a Reddit-like application, with all features built from scratch without relying on any external libraries or gems (including authentication, simple admin roles and URL-slugging).

The [example app](https://tl-postit.herokuapp.com/) uses Bootstrap v2 however I choose to use v3 to make my project responsive.
