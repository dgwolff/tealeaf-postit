## Postit!

This is the app from [Tealeaf Academy's](http://gotealeaf.com) Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails course.

It's still a work in progress, and I'm adding some additional functionality as I go which I'll document once I've completed the project.

The [example app](https://tl-postit.herokuapp.com/) uses Bootstrap v2 however I choose to use v3 to make my project responsive.

- Sample data with faker
- Pagination with will_paginate and bootstrap-will_paginate
